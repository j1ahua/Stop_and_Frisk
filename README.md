# Stop_and_Frisk

The goal of this assignment is to allow you to draw conclusions about social bias using real data from the New York Police Department. In 1964, the New York State passed a policing law called “Stop and Frisk” which enables officers to stop and “frisk” (briefly search) a person that they deem to be suspicious. A person who is stopped has not necessarily committed a crime; people are presumed innocent until proven guilty by the courts. However, data has shown that there exists significant discrimination, including racial and gender bias, regarding which individuals are more likely to be stopped.
